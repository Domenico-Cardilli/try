      <p class="tree"> <em> Hello, <br> My name is Domenico Cardilli and I am a 29 years old cloud computing student. <br>
          In my professional experiences, I have been working for many years within the hospitality industry while
          I have been developing amazing problem solving, teamwork and interpersonal skills. <br>
          I have always been a hard worker and a fast learner. Moved by a real passion for technologies, and a strong motivation to begin
          a career in IT, I have started my university studies in February 2020. <br>
          I have been able to create some small applications using Python and some videogames with C# and Unity 3D engine
          and I have built this small website
          using HTML and some CSS. <br>
          Moreover, I have deepened my knowledge about operating systems, computer hardware and
          networking. I am a person who loves to take on challenges and learn new skills. <br>
          I like to dedicate my free time to do some sports and new interesting projects. </p>
